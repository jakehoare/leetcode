# https://leetcode.com/problems/masking-personal-information/
# We are given a personal information string S, which may represent either an email address or a phone number.
# We would like to mask this personal information according to the following rules:
# 1. Email address:
# We define a name to be a string of length ≥ 2 consisting of only lowercase letters a-z or uppercase letters A-Z.
# An email address starts with a name, followed by the symbol '@', followed by a name, followed by the dot '.'
# and followed by a name.
# All email addresses are guaranteed to be valid and in the format of "name1@name2.name3".
# To mask an email, all names must be converted to lowercase and all letters between the first and last letter of the
# first name must be replaced by 5 asterisks '*'.
# 2. Phone number:
# A phone number is a string consisting of only the digits 0-9 or the characters from the set {'+', '-', '(', ')', ' '}.
# You may assume a phone number contains 10 to 13 digits.
# The last 10 digits make up the local number, while the digits before those make up the country code.
# Note that the country code is optional. We want to expose only the last 4 digits and mask all other digits.
# The local number should be formatted and masked as "***-***-1111", where 1 represents the exposed digits.
# To mask a phone number with country code like "+111 111 111 1111", we write it in the form "+***-***-***-1111".
# The '+' sign and the first '-' sign before the local number should only exist if there is a country code.
# For example, a 12 digit phone number mask should start with "+**-".
# Note that extraneous characters like "(", ")", " ", as well as extra dashes or plus signs not part of the above
# formatting scheme should be removed.
# Return the correct "mask" of the information provided.

# If S contains "@" it is an email. Split email by "@", amend name to first and last letters.
# If phone, retain all digits and split into country (maybe empty) and local.
# Time - O(n)
# Space - O(n)

            name, address = S.lower().split("@")
            return name[0] + "*****" + name[-1] + "@" + address

        digits = [c for c in S if "0" <= c <= "9"]          # remove all non-digits

            result = ["+"] + ["*"] * len(country) + ["-"]   # masked country with "+" prefix

        return "".join(result)
